A long time ago, there was a monkey who lived in a rose-apple tree by the side of a river. He lived alone, but was very happy.
One day, a crocodile came out of the river. He swam up to the tree and told the monkey that he had travelled a long distance
 and was in search of food as he was very hungry. The kind monkey offered him a few rose apples. The crocodile thanked him and asked him if he could visit the monkey again.
"You are always welcome," said the monkey.
